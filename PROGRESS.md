Sprint: meta
Feature: META-001
Title: Create thinmint planning, sprint, checkpoint, and logging docs
Reason selected: required bootstrap before autonomous coding can run safely
Files changed: OPENCODE.md, ENGINE_PLAN.md, CHECKPOINTS.md, LOGGING.md, PROGRESS.md, SPRINT.json, SPRINT.01.bootstrap-core.json, SPRINT.02.legal-movegen.json, SPRINT.03.uci-search.json, SPRINT.04.strength-stability.json, scripts/opencode-loop.sh
Tests run: not applicable
Perft status: not applicable
Git checkpoint: pending
Result: success
Known risks:
- no engine code or verification script exists yet
- active sprint file still assumes a future language/toolchain choice
Next suggested feature: S01-F01 choose the implementation language and initialize the project
